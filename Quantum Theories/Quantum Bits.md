# Quantum Bits

Quantum bits (qubits) are the base of a quantum system.

## A Quantum Bit

> Reference: section 1.2, *Quantum Computation and Quantum Information*.

Like the *bit* we know from information theory, a quantum bit have two *basic* states, |0> and |1>. The difference between a `bit` and a `qubit` is a `qubit` can be in a state *other* than |0> and |1>. It is also possible to form *linear combinations* of states, often called *superpositions*.

$|\psi> = \alpha|0> + \beta|1>$

Notation `|>`, is called the *Dirac notation*, the standard notation for states in quantum mechanics.
