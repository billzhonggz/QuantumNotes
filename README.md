# Quantum Notes

Notes on quantum-related topics.

Most of the notes come from these books.

- Michael A. Nielsen and Isaac L. Chuang, **Quantum Computation and Quantum Information**, Cambridge University Press, 2015
- Gilles Van Assche, **Quantum Cryptography and Secret-Key Distillation**, Cambridge University Press, 2006

I will put the references on each file (remind me if forgot).

## LaTeX Expressions

The notes were written in Markdown format with [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/) plugin on [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). All of the LaTeX expressions in the notes can be rendered by [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) included in Markdown Preview Enhanced plugin.

Since GitHub does not provide LaTeX rendering, I will provide PDF version along with the Markdown files for notes with many LaTeX expressions.
